### Source is part of [*dart source leaks*](https://pastebin.com/Fg38ZKk8) (leaking all sources i've made/helped for dart)

# Description
This source can really be used almost out of the box, all you need is a database (postgresql used originally) and some common knowledge, you can generate license keys based on what type (day/week/month/lifetime), and the user can redeem them, it also has automatic checking if its expired or not every minute, this code can be much more improved but this was made when I knew a bit less about databases etc.

# Requirements
* Python 3.10.x or lower (3.11 probably not supported)
* Common knowledge
* PostgreSQL Database
* All the requirements for python must be installed, you can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the same folder where `requirements.txt` is in.

# License
There is no license, I don't care you can use this however you want.
